<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/562041975797317643/754150540094734356/iu_preview1.png?width=960&height=600">

I came to a realization that I was eventually clicking all of the links in the college emails I was receiving. So I figured it just made sense to try and automate the process.

Current Functions
* Scan a single email and open the links
* Scan your visible inbox, filter by keywords (University, College, Admission), fetch the contents of the email then treat it essentially as scanning a single email. After fetching the list of emails, it only scans and opens links from one at a time.

### Built With
* [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

* None

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/th-ms/interestUpper.git
```
2. Enable Developer Mode in chrome://extensions/
3. Drag and drop the interestUpper folder onto the webpage



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

To scan a single email, simply open the email in Gmail, open the extension, then click Scan Email.

To scan your visible inbox, you need to switch to HTML view on Gmail, which is easily done by following the instruction on the extension. After that, the extension will scan emails looking for keywords related to admissions, then open links from each email.
