<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<img src="https://i.gyazo.com/5bf403244adec2ebb73c65b13940efeb.png">

This is my take on an anonymous chat platform based on websockets. This was inspired by a tutorial by Pretty Printed, but utilized my own HTML, JS, and CSS.

Here's why:
* No logs of chat or who's who
* After every refresh a new name is assigned, so it's designed to be anonymous
* Extremely simple to join a room and start talking

### Built With
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
* [Node](https://nodejs.org)
* [Express](https://expressjs.com)
* [SocketIO](https://socket.io)

To scan your visible inbox, you need to switch to HTML view on Gmail, which is easily done by following the instruction on the browser. After that, the extension will scan emails looking for keywords related to admissions, then open links from each email.
